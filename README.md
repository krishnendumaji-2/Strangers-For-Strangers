# PROBLEM:

Tragedyâ€™s hand might be unpredictable, but the road to recovery can be made less painful.When a disaster strikes, most of the times people loose their houses and also get deprived of basic amenities like safe drinking water, food, etc.Our Open Door Houses not only provide immediate and short-term shelter for the victims of a disaster, but they also help them to recover from the trauma of a disaster and provide a base to start the process of rehabilitation. Unlike public relief camps,where there is a sense of despair in the air,we provide homely atmosphere and support,and also help them to locate their needs.

# SOLUTION:

We aim to build a web application, which helps the victims of a disaster to locate the nearest houses open to them alongwith providing some necessary details. People willing to help the victims shall provide the details to our website :
1.Name of the person who is willing to share his home.
2.Exact location of house.
3.Contact number.
4.Number of people you can accomodate at maximum.
5.Is there a woman in the house.

All these information will be recorded in our database and made available to the victims  through this web-app and then he/she can decide which house to choose.

# TECHNOLOGIES:

The Azure Maps search service helps the person in need to locate the open door houses where he/she can find shelter during the calamity.
1. From the database collected from the website,we mark the houses on the maps using geocoding. 
2. We shall use features of Azure Map API like Near-By search to locate all the shelters in a definite range of the location of evacuee.
3. Each such location when selected shall give the required details.

# POSITIVES:

1. This helps to reduce the overcrowding and ill management at public rescue shelters and thus helps in better allocation of shelter to the evacuees.
2. Further the detail about presence of a woman in the house will specially mark it to ensure the comfortable stay of female evacuees.
