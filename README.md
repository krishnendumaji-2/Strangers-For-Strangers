## PROBLEM:

Tragedyâ€™s hand might be unpredictable, but the road to recovery can be made less painful.When a disaster strikes, most of the times people loose their houses and also get deprived of basic amenities like safe drinking water, food, etc. In public relief camps,where there is a sense of despair in the air and over-crowding . This is a major problem which needs to be addressed. 

## SOLUTION:
Our solution encourages common people to render their houses to the victims of the disaster for a short time period.Our Open Door Houses not only provide immediate and short-term shelter for the victims of a disaster, but they also help them to recover from the trauma of a disaster and provide a base to start the process of rehabilitation.
We aim to build a web application, which helps the victims of a disaster to locate the nearest houses open to them along with providing some necessary details. People willing to help the victims shall provide the details to our website :<br/>
1.Name of the person who is willing to share his home.<br/>
2.Exact location of house.<br/>
3.Contact number.<br/>
4.Number of people you can accomodate at maximum.<br/>
5.Is there a woman in the house.<br/>

All these information will be recorded in our database and made available to the victims  through this web-app and then he/she can decide which house to choose.

## TECHNOLOGIES:

The Azure Maps search service helps the person in need to locate the open door houses where he/she can find shelter during the calamity.<br/>
1. From the database collected from the website,we mark the houses on the maps using geocoding. <br/>
2. We shall use features of Azure Map API like Near-By search to locate all the shelters in a definite range of the location of evacuee.<br/>
3. Each such location when selected shall give the required details.

## POSITIVES:

1. This helps to reduce the overcrowding and ill management at public rescue shelters and thus helps in better allocation of shelter to the evacuees.<br/>
2. Further the detail about presence of a woman in the house will specially mark it to ensure the comfortable stay of female evacuees.
